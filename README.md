According to separate research conducted by the University of Miami, 
[see here](https://news.miami.edu/stories/2020/08/having-a-doctor-who-shares-the-same-race-may-ease-patients-angst.html) ,
 and the University of Pennsylvania, 
[see here](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2020/november/study-finds-patients-prefer-doctors-who-share-their-same-race-ethnicity), 
when doctors are of the same race as their patients, it can forge a sense of comfort that helps to reduce anxiety and pain, particularly for Black patients. Hence, based on those findings, the primary purpose of this project is to connect patients with doctors who are of the same race/ethnicity/gender or who speak their native languages.
