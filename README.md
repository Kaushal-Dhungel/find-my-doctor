According to separate researches conducted by the University of Miami, 
[see here](https://news.miami.edu/stories/2020/08having-a-doctor-who-shares-the-same-race-may-ease-patients-angst.html) ,
 and the University of Pennsylvania, 
[see here](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2020/november/study-finds-patients-prefer-doctors-who-share-their-same-race-ethnicity) , 
when doctors are of the same race as their patients, it can forge a sense of comfort that helps to reduce anxiety and pain, particularly for Black patients. Hence, based on those findings, the primary purpose of this project is to connect patients with the doctors who are of the same race/ethnicity or who speak their native languages.
